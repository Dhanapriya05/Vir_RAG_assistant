# 📄 PDF RAG Chatbot

An AI-powered chatbot that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions in natural language. The application uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to retrieve relevant information from the uploaded document and generate accurate responses using a Large Language Model (LLM).

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload PDF documents
- 💬 Ask questions about the uploaded document
- 🧠 Semantic search using vector embeddings
- 🔍 Retrieves only relevant document chunks
- 🤖 AI-generated responses using Groq LLM
- 📚 Supports conversation history
- 🎯 Searches only within the currently uploaded document
- ⚡ FastAPI backend with Streamlit frontend

## 🧠 How It Works

### Document Processing

1. User uploads a PDF.
2. The PDF text is extracted.
3. The text is split into smaller chunks.
4. Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings.
5. Embeddings are stored in ChromaDB.

### Question Answering

1. User asks a question.
2. The question is converted into an embedding.
3. ChromaDB retrieves the most relevant chunks.
4. Retrieved context is combined with the user's question.
5. The prompt is sent to Groq LLM.
6. The generated answer is displayed to the user.
